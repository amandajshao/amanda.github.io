<span style="color:red">**[News!]**</span> Jing Shao is currently at [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) as a research scientist focusing on multi-modal foundation models and agents, with special interests in understanding various properties of current models beyond their accuracy, such as explainability, robustness, safety and generalization, towards the reliableness of AI systems. She is also an Adjunt Ph.D. supervisor at the [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), and a Co-PI of [S-Lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/s-lab) in [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). She received her Ph.D. (2016) in Electronic Engineering from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/), and work closely with [Prof. Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/index.html) and the [Multimedia Lab (MMLab)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) led by [Prof. Xiaoou Tang](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/people/xotang.shtml). 

She has published 40+ peer-reviewed articles (including 20 first/co-first/corresponding author papers) in top-tier conferences and journals such as TPAMI, IJCV, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS and CVPR, with 7300+ citations in Google Scholar. She serves as the reviewer of IJCV, T-PAMI, T-CSVT, T-MM, T-ITS, and CVIU, and reviewed CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI, and ACM MM.

<span style="color:red">**We are hiring Full-time Researchers/Interns working together on safety/robustness/explainablity of generative models and agents. I am also looking for talented students targeted to Master or Ph.D. degree. Please drop me an email if you are interested.**</span>

# She is currently a Research Director in [SenseTime Group Limited](https://www.sensetime.com), and an Adjunct Ph.D. Supervisor at the [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). She is a Co-PI of [S-Lab]() in [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). She received her Ph.D. (2016) in Electronic Engineering from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/), and work closely with [Prof. Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/index.html) and the [Multimedia Lab (MMLab)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) led by [Prof. Xiaoou Tang](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/people/xotang.shtml). 

# Her research interests lies at the computer vision and multimedia, with focus on generating, perceiving, and understanding the 2D/3D visual world, for instance,

# - Multimodal LLM
# - General Vision Representation
# - Human-centric Understanding and Generation (Face, Body, Scene, and *etc*).
