abstract: In this paper, we tackle the vehicle Re-identification (ReID) problem which
  is of great importance in urban surveillance and can be used for multiple applications.
  In our vehicle ReID framework, an orientation invariant feature embedding module
  and a spatial-temporal regularization module are proposed. With orientation invariant
  feature embedding, local region features of different orientations can be extracted
  based on 20 key point locations and can be well aligned and combined. With spatial-temporal
  regularization, the log-normal distribution is adopted to model the spatial-temporal
  constraints and the retrieval results can be refined. Experiments are conducted
  on public vehicle ReID datasets and our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
  performance. Investigations of the proposed framework is conducted, including the
  landmark regressor and comparisons with attention mechanism. Both the orientation
  invariant feature embedding and the spatio-temporal regularization achieve considerable
  improvements.
