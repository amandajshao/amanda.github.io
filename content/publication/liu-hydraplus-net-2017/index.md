abstract: 'Pedestrian analysis plays a vital role in intelligent video surveillance
  and is a key component for security-centric computer vision systems. Despite that
  the convolutional neural networks are remarkable in learning discriminative features
  from images, the learning of comprehensive features of pedestrians for fine-grained
  tasks remains an open problem. In this study, we propose a new attentionbased deep
  neural network, named as HydraPlus-Net (HPnet), that multi-directionally feeds the
  multi-level attention maps to different feature layers. The attentive deep features
  learned from the proposed HP-net bring unique advantages: (1) the model is capable
  of capturing multiple attentions from low-level to semantic-level, and (2) it explores
  the multi-scale selectiveness of attentive features to enrich the final feature
  representations for a pedestrian image. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generality
  of the proposed HP-net for pedestrian analysis on two tasks, i.e. pedestrian attribute
  recognition and person reidentification. Intensive experimental results have been
  provided to prove that the HP-net outperforms the state-of-theart methods on various
  datasets.'
