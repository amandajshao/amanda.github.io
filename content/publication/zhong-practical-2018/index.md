abstract: 'Convolutional neural networks have gained a remarkable success in computer
  vision. However, most usable network architectures are hand-crafted and usually
  require expertise and elaborate design. In this paper, we provide a block-wise network
  generation pipeline called BlockQNN which automatically builds high-performance
  networks using the Q-Learning paradigm with epsilon-greedy exploration strategy.
  The optimal network block is constructed by the learning agent which is trained
  sequentially to choose component layers. We stack the block to construct the whole
  auto-generated network. To accelerate the generation process, we also propose a
  distributed asynchronous framework and an early stop strategy. The block-wise generation
  brings unique advantages: (1) it performs competitive results in comparison to the
  hand-crafted state-of-the-art networks on image classiÔ¨Åcation, additionally, the
  best network generated by BlockQNN achieves 3.54% top-1 error rate on CIFAR-10 which
  beats all existing auto-generate networks. (2) in the meanwhile, it offers tremendous
  reduction of the search space in designing networks which only spends 3 days with
  32 GPUs, and (3) moreover, it has strong generalizability that the network built
  on CIFAR also performs well on a larger-scale ImageNet dataset.'
