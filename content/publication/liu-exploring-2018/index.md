abstract: This paper proposes learning disentangled but complementary face features
  with a minimal supervision by face identiﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, we construct an identity
  Distilling and Dispelling Autoencoder (D2AE) framework that adversarially learns
  the identity-distilled features for identity veriﬁcation and the identity-dispelled
  features to fool the veriﬁcation system. Thanks to the design of two-stream cues,
  the learned disentangled features represent not only the identity or attribute but
  the complete input image. Comprehensive evaluations further demonstrate that the
  proposed features not only preserve state-of-the-art identity veriﬁcation performance
  on LFW, but also acquire comparable discriminative power for face attribute recognition
  on CelebA and LFWA. Moreover, the proposed system is ready to semantically control
  the face generation/editing based on various identities and attributes in an unsupervised
  manner.
