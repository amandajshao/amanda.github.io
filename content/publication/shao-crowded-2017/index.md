abstract: Crowd video analysis is one of the hallmark tasks of crowded scene understanding.
  While we observe a tremendous progress in image-based tasks with the rise of convolutional
  neural networks (CNNs), performance on video analysis has not (yet) attained the
  same level of success. In this paper, we introduce intuitive but effective temporal-aware
  crowd motion channels by uniformly slicing the video volume from different dimensions.
  Multiple CNN structures with different data-fusion strategies and weight-sharing
  schemes are proposed to learn the connectivity both spatially and temporally from
  these motion channels. To well demonstrate our deep model, we construct a new large-scale
  Who do What at someWhere crowd data set with 10 000 videos from 8257 crowded scenes,
  and build an attribute set with 94 attributes. Extensive experiments on crowd video
  attribute prediction demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel method over the
  state-of-the-art.
