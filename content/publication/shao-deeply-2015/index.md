abstract: Crowded scene understanding is a fundamental problem in computer vision.
  In this study, we develop a multi-task deep model to jointly learn and combine appearance
  and motion features for crowd understanding. We propose crowd motion channels as
  the input of the deep model and the channel design is inspired by generic properties
  of crowd systems. To well demonstrate our deep model, we construct a new large-scale
  WWW Crowd dataset with 10, 000 videos from 8, 257 crowded scenes, and build an attribute
  set with 94 attributes on WWW. We further measure user study performance on WWW
  and compare this with the proposed deep models. Extensive experiments show that
  our deep models display significant performance improvements in cross-scene attribute
  recognition compared to strong crowd-related feature-based baselines, and the deeply
  learned features behave a superior performance in multi-task learning.
