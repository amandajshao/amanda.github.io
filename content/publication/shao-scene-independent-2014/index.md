abstract: Groups are the primary entities that make up a crowd. Understanding group-level
  dynamics and properties is thus scientifically important and practically useful
  in a wide range of applications, especially for crowd understanding. In this study
  we show that fundamental group-level properties, such as intra-group stability and
  inter-group conflict, can be systematically quantified by visual descriptors. This
  is made possible through learning a novel Collective Transition prior, which leads
  to a robust approach for group segregation in public spaces. From the prior, we
  further devise a rich set of group property visual descriptors. These descriptors
  are scene-independent, and can be effectively applied to public-scene with variety
  of crowd densities and distributions. Extensive experiments on hundreds of public
  scene video clips demonstrate that such property descriptors are not only useful
  but also necessary for group state analysis and crowd scene understanding.
