abstract: Zero-shot artistic style transfer is an important image synthesis problem
  aiming at transferring arbitrary style into content images. However, the trade-off
  between the generalization and efﬁciency in existing methods impedes a high quality
  zero-shot style transfer in real-time. In this paper, we resolve this dilemma and
  propose an efﬁcient yet effective Avatar-Net that enables visually plausible multiscale
  transfer for arbitrary style. The key ingredient of our method is a style decorator
  that makes up the content features by semantically aligned style features from an
  arbitrary style image, which does not only holistically match their feature distributions
  but also preserve detailed style patterns in the decorated features. By embedding
  this module into an image reconstruction network that fuses multiscale style abstractions,
  the Avatar-Net renders multi-scale stylization for any style image in one feed-forward
  pass. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art effectiveness and efﬁciency of the proposed
  method in generating high-quality stylized images, with a series of successive applications
  include multiple style integration, video stylization and etc.
