abstract: Events are fundamental building blocks of real-world happenings. In this
  paper, we present a large-scale, multi-modal event knowledge graph named MMEKG.
  MMEKG unifies different modalities of knowledge via events, which complement and
  disambiguate each other.Specifically, MMEKG incorporates (i) over 990 thousand concept
  events with 644 relation types to cover most types of happenings, and (ii) over
  863 million instance events connected through 934 million relations, which provide
  rich contextual information in texts and/or images. To collect billion-scale instance
  events and relations among them, we additionally develop an efficient yet effective
  pipeline for textual/visual knowledge extraction system. We also develop an induction
  strategy to create million-scale concept events and a schema organizing all events
  and relations in MMEKG. To this end, we also provide a pipeline enabling our system
  to seamlessly parse texts/images to event graphs and to retrieve multi-modal knowledge
  at both concept- and instance-levels.
